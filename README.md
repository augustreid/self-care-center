The app loads with a `login page` where the user can enter their name and **click**
the `Teach Me Serenity` button. If the user does not enter anything, they will receive
an alert message.

The user will then see the `main page`, which has a personalized greeting and
a `Receive Message` button to display either an affirmation or a mantra.
If user does not select a message type, the displayed message will ask them to
choose a message type.

The meditating person/bell image will be replaced by either an affirmation or a mantra,
randomly selected from a list. The user can continue clicking the `Receive Message` button
to see new messages. There is also a `Fresh Start` button, which clears a message from
the text box and displays the meditation image again.
